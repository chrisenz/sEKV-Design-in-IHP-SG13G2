# Design of the Symmetrical OTA

This example presents the analysis, design and simulation of the symmetrical OTA using the inversion coefficient approach and the sEKV model. The design is performed for the IHP SG13G2 BiCMOS process. We have chosen this process because IHP offers an open source PDK. The simulations are performed with the ngspice simulator with the PSP compact model and the parameters provided by the open source PDK.

The design and verification is performed in the Quarto notebook. An example of design is given in the [pdf file](Symmetrical_OTA.pdf).
