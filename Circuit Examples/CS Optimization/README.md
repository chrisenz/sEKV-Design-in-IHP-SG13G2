# Common source optimization for minimum current

This circuit example shows various optimizations using the inversion coefficient. In particular, it shows how to optimize a common-source (CS) gain stage for a given gain-bandwidth product and DC gain. The design examples are performed in the [Quarto Notebook](CS_optimization.qmd) and validated with ngspice simulations. The results are presented in the [pdf report](CS_optimization.pdf).
